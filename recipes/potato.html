        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Latkes (potato pancakes) are a must-have at Hanukkah, but are really wonderful any time of the year! This is my mother's recipe, which is honestly the best potato latke I've had. I usually end up making a second batch because they disappear so quickly. I've tried other recipes and always return to this one. Lovely topped with sour cream or applesauce.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups shredded potato</li>
            <li>1/4 cup grated onion</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>6 saltine crackers</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix potato, onion, eggs, crushed crackers, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl</li>
            <li>Heat 1/4 inch oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat</li>
            <li>Drop spoonfuls of the potato mixture, first pressing potato mixture against the side of the bowl to remove excess liquid, into the hot oil; slightly flatten the latkes into the oil with the back of your spoon so they are an even thickness.</li>
            <li>Cook in batches in the hot oil until browned and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Drain latkes on a paper towel-line plate.</li>
        </ol>
